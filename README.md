# SysTick

Study assignment based on the virtual implementation of a Systick timer. According to the documentation, the simulation contains the Systick model with its most important functionalities. Class StysTick contains its registers and methods that allow operating on the most prime data fields. The program follows Object Oriented programming paradigms. The applicationâ€™s GUI is written by using the Swing library. 
To fix:
- Sistick should implement Action Listener (it will clean up Frame.java code)
